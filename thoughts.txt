--- What I have ---

var book = current book
  each client gets this variable
  when one client changes the variable
    all clients are effected


--- What I need ---

no variable
  on load 
    pass text + filename, currentchapref, paragaph
  on function call
    pass back filename, currentchapref, paragaph if needed
      i.e. for moving between chapters an paragraphs


--- How an action should look ---

user connects to site
  user is sent text + filename(string), (maybe) currentchapref(int), paragraph(int)
user clicks next paragraph button 
  user sends back useful information
    i.e. filename, current paragraph index(int)
  server calls NextParagraph(filename, currentparagraph)
    server gets booktext of filename
      server returns booktext[currentparagraph+1] and currentparagraph+1 
  user receives new text(string) and new paragraph(int)
