## BookBytes 2.0
Things are coming together.
Interface is HEAVILY borrowed from the clickbaiter project by cbrgm found here: https://github.com/cbrgm/clickbaiter/

### Goals
- [x] Better data passing through functions
- [x] New buttons for displaying title and author
- [x] Build "booktext" out of "fulltext"
- [x] Maybe begin random selection of paragraphs and/or books
- [x] Random file selection
- [] Select new book from ui

### Problems
- Franklin Autobiography is a formatting mess.
