## BookBytes 2.0
#### Short book passages to pique your interest
Things are coming together.
Interface is HEAVILY borrowed from the clickbaiter project by cbrgm found here: https://github.com/cbrgm/clickbaiter/

### Goals
- [x] Better data passing through functions
- [x] New buttons for displaying title and author
- [x] Build "booktext" out of "fulltext"
- [x] Maybe begin random selection of paragraphs and/or books
- [x] Random file selection
- [x] Select new book from ui
- [ ] Address some "problems"

### Problems
- Franklin Autobiography is a formatting mess.
- ~~Title formatting starts after first colon, makes bad things happen.~~
  - Frankenstein has a br tag that messes things up a bit..
- ~~Random file selection sometimes returns no file.~~
